abstract = {The gluon action density in a static mesonic system is analyzed at finite temperature using lattice QCD techniques in quenched QCD. The obtained results are compared to predictions of bosonic string models for the flux-tube profiles to understand the changes of the flux-tube profiles with temperature. The mesonic flux tube curved-width profile is found to compare well with that of the bosonic string at large distances. In the intermediate distance region, a free bosonic string behaviour is observed for analysis performed on highly UV-filtered gauge configurations. Extending the analysis to the static baryon reveals a delocalization of the baryonic node in the Y-shape gluonic configuration observed at zero temperature. At finite temperature, a filled delta-shaped configuration is observed, even at large distances. We study a baryonic string model at finite temperature.},

abstract = {In this paper we re-derive the effective Nambu-Goto theory result for the Polyakov loop correlator, starting from the free bosonic string and using a covariant quantization. The boundary conditions are those of an open string attached to two D0-branes at spatial distance R, in a target space with compact euclidean time. The one-loop free energy contains topologically distinct sectors corresponding to multiple covers of the cylinder in target space bordered by the Polyakov loops. The sector that winds once reproduces exactly the Nambu-Goto partition function. In our approach, the world-sheet duality between the open and closed channel is most evident and allows for an explicit interpretation of the free energy in terms of tree level exchange of closed strings between boundary states. Our treatment is fully consistent only in d = 26; extension to generic d may be justified for large R, and is supported by Montecarlo data. At shorter scales, consistency and Montecarlo data seem to suggest the necessity of taking into account the Liouville mode of Polyakov's formulation.},

Our expression, obtained by operatorial methods, resums the loop expansion of the NG model in the ``physical gauge'' computed perturbatively by functional integral methods in the literature. Recently, very accurate Monte Carlo data for the interface free energy in the 3d Ising model became available. Our proposed expression compares very well to the data for values of the area sufficiently large in terms of the inverse string tension. This pattern is expected on theoretical grounds and agrees with previous analyses of other observables in the Ising model.},

abstract = {Our view of marine microbes is transforming, as culture-independent methods facilitate rapid characterization of microbial diversity. It is difficult to assimilate this information into our understanding of marine microbe ecology and evolution, because their distributions, traits, and genomes are shaped by forces that are complex and dynamic. Here we incorporate diverse forces-physical, biogeochemical, ecological, and mutational-into a global ocean model to study selective pressures on a simple trait in a widely distributed lineage of picophytoplankton: the nitrogen use abilities of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria. Some Prochlorococcus ecotypes have lost the ability to use nitrate, whereas their close relatives, marine Synechococcus, typically retain it. We impose mutations for the loss of nitrogen use abilities in modeled picophytoplankton, and ask: in which parts of the ocean are mutants most disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate, and in which parts are they least disadvantaged? Our model predicts that this selective disadvantage is smallest for picophytoplankton that live in tropical regions where Prochlorococcus are abundant in the real ocean. Conversely, the selective disadvantage of losing the ability to use nitrate is larger for modeled picophytoplankton that live at higher latitudes, where Synechococcus are abundant. In regions where we expect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations to cycle seasonally in the real ocean, we find that model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Prochlorococcus are less disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate than model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Synechococcus. The model predictions for the selective advantage associated with nitrate use are broadly consistent with the distribution of this ability among marine picocyanobacteria, and at finer scales, can provide insights into interactions between temporally varying ocean processes and selective pressures that may be difficult or impossible to study by other means. More generally, and perhaps more importantly, this study introduces an approach for testing hypotheses about the processes that underlie genetic variation among marine microbes, embedded in the dynamic physical, chemical, and biological forces that generate and shape this diversity.},

abstract = {A golden age for heavy-quarkonium physics dawned a decade ago, initiated by the confluence of exciting advances in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and an explosion of related experimental activity. The early years of this period were chronicled in the Quarkonium Working Group (QWG) CERN Yellow Report (YR) in 2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that time and provided specific recommendations for further progress. However, the broad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles could only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII program concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the B-factories and CLEO-c flourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the Tevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the deconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality, precision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for continuing investigations at BESIII, the LHC, RHIC, FAIR, the Super Flavor and/or Tau-Charm factories, JLab, the ILC, and beyond. The list of newly found conventional states expanded to include h(c)(1P), chi(c2)(2P), B-c(+), and eta(b)(1S). In addition, the unexpected and still-fascinating X(3872) has been joined by more than a dozen other charmonium- and bottomonium-like "XYZ" states that appear to lie outside the quark model. Many of these still need experimental confirmation. The plethora of new states unleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such as quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks. Measurements of the spectroscopy, decays, production, and in-medium behavior of c (c) over bar, b (b) over bar, and b (c) over bar bound states have been shown to validate some theoretical approaches to QCD and highlight lack of quantitative success for others. Lattice QCD has grown from a tool with computational possibilities to an industrial-strength effort now dependent more on insight and innovation than pure computational power. New effective field theories for the description of quarkonium in different regimes have been developed and brought to a high degree of sophistication, thus enabling precise and solid theoretical predictions. Many expected decays and transitions have either been measured with precision or for the first time, but the confusing patterns of decays, both above and below open-flavor thresholds, endure and have deepened. The intriguing details of quarkonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions that have emerged from RHIC have elevated the importance of separating hot- and cold-nuclear-matter effects in quark-gluon plasma studies. This review systematically addresses all these matters and concludes by prioritizing directions for ongoing and future efforts.},

abstract = {We elaborate on the fact that quarkonium in hot QCD should not be thought of as a stationary bound state in a temperature-dependent real potential, but as a short-lived transient, with an exponentially decaying wave function. The reason is the existence of an imaginary part in the pertinent static potential, signalling the ``disappearance'', due to inelastic scatterings with hard particles in the plasma, of the off-shell gluons that bind the quarks together. By solving the corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we estimate numerically the near-threshold spectral functions in scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial vector channels, as a function of the temperature and of the heavy quark mass. In particular, we point out a subtlety in the determination of the scalar channel spectral function and, resolving it to the best of our understanding, suggest that at least in the bottomonium case, a resonance peak can be observed also in the scalar channel, even though it is strongly suppressed with respect to the peak in the vector channel. Finally, we plot the physical dilepton production rate, stressing that despite the eventual disappearance of the resonance peak from the corresponding spectral function, the quarkonium contribution to the dilepton rate becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature, because of the yield from free heavy quarks.},

By using the form factor approach and perturbed conformal field theory methods we are able to describe both the large distance and the short distance behaviours of the correlators. We compare our predictions with a set of high precision Monte Carlo simulations (performed on the triangular lattice realization of the model) finding a complete agreement in both regimes. In particular we use the two-point correlators to. x the various non-universal constants involved in the comparison ( whose determination is one of the results of our analysis) and then use these constants to compare numerical results and theoretical predictions for the three-point correlator with no free parameter. Our results can be used to shed some light on the behaviour of the three- quark correlator in the con. ning phase of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional SU( 3) lattice gauge theory which is related by dimensional reduction to the three- spin correlator in the high temperature phase of the three-state Potts model. The picture which emerges is that of a smooth crossover between Delta-type law at short distances and a Y-type law at large distances.},

abstract = {The Villain form of SO(3) lattice gauge theory is studied and compared to Wilson's SU(2) theory. The topological invariants in SO(3) which correspond to twisted boundary conditions in SU(2) are discussed and lattice observables are introduced for them. An apparent SO(3) phase with negative adjoint Polyakov loop is explained in terms of these observables. The electric twist free energy, an order parameter for the confinement-deconfinement transition, is measured in both theories to calibrate the temperature. The results indicate that lattices with about 7004 sites or larger will be needed to study the SO(3) confined phase. Alternative actions are discussed and an analytic path connecting SO(3) and SU(2) lattice gauge theory at weak coupling is exhibited. The relevance for confinement of the centre of the gauge group is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We derive effective actions for SU(2) Polyakov loops using inverse Monte Carlo techniques. In a
 first approach, we determine the effective couplings by requiring that the effective ensemble
 reproduces the single-site distribution of the Polyakov loops. The latter is flat below the critical
 temperature implying that the (untraced) Polyakov loop is distributed uniformly over its target
 space, the SU(2) group manifold. This allows for an analytic determination of the Binder cumulant
 and the distribution of the mean-field, which turns out to be approximately gaussian. In a second
 approach, we employ novel lattice Schwinger-Dyson equations which reflect the SU(2) × SU(2)
 invariance of the functional Haar measure. Expanding the effective action in terms of SU(2) group
 characters makes the numerics sufficiently stable so that we are able to extract a total number of
 14 couplings. The resulting action is short-ranged and reproduces the Yang-Mills correlators very
 well.},

This new formulation requires no assumption that the mean scalar field is small and hence constitutes a significant advance over earlier work. The similarity of the effective interaction to the widely used SkM∗ force encourages us to apply it to a wide range of nuclear problems, beginning with the binding energies and charge distributions of doubly magic nuclei. Finding acceptable results in this conventional arena, we apply the same effective interaction, within the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov approach, to the properties of nuclei far from stability. The resulting two neutron drip lines and shell quenching are quite satisfactory. Finally, we apply the relativistic formulation to the properties of dense nuclear matter in anticipation of future application to the properties of neutron stars.},

abstract = {We study theories with the exceptional gauge group G(2). The 14 adjoint "gluons" of a G(2) gauge theory transform as \{3\}, \{(3) over bar\} and \{8\} under the subgroup SU(3), and hence have the color quantum numbers of ordinary quarks, anti-quarks and gluons in QCD. Since G(2) has a trivial center, a "quark" in the (7) representation of G(2) can be screened by "gluons". As a result, in G(2) Yang-Mills theory the string between a pair of static "quarks" can break. In G(2) QCD there is a hybrid consisting of one "quark" and three "gluons". In supersymmetric G(2) Yang-Mills theory with a \{14\} Majorana "gluino" the chiral symmetry is Z(4)(X). Chiral symmetry breaking gives rise to distinct confined phases separated by confined-confined domain walls. A scalar Higgs field in the \{7\} representation breaks G(2) to SU(3) and allows us to interpolate between theories with exceptional and ordinary confinement. We also present strong coupling lattice calculations that reveal basic features of G(2) confinement. Just as in QCD, where dynamical quarks break the Z(3) symmetry explicitly, G(2) gauge theories confine even without a center. However, there is not necessarily a deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Some time ago, Svetitsky and Yaffe have argued that—if the deconfinement phase transition of a (d+1)-dimensional Yang–Mills theory with gauge group G is second order—it should be in the universality class of a d-dimensional spin model symmetric under the center of G. For d=3 these arguments have been confirmed numerically only in the SU(2) case with center , simply because all SU(N) Yang–Mills theories with N⩾3 seem to have non-universal first order phase transitions. The symplectic groups Sp(N) also have the center  and provide another extension of SU(2)=Sp(1) to general N. Using lattice simulations, we find that the deconfinement phase transition of Sp(2) Yang–Mills theory is first order in 3+1 dimensions, while in 2+1 dimensions stronger fluctuations induce a second order transition. In agreement with the Svetitsky–Yaffe conjecture, for (2+1)d Sp(2) Yang–Mills theory we find the universal critical behavior of the 2d Ising model. For Sp(3) Yang–Mills theory the transition is first order both in 2+1 and in 3+1 dimensions. This suggests that the size of the gauge group—and not the center symmetry—determines the order of the deconfinement phase transition.},

We apply this result to study the phase structures of G 2 , SO( N ) and Sp(2 N ) gauge theories which turn out to be in qualitative agreement with the results of lattice calculations. On S 3 × S 1 , at zero temperature, the Polyakov loop is zero for kinematical reasons. For small but non-zero temperature, the Polyakov loop is still zero if the gauge theory has an unbroken center, while it acquires a small vacuum expectation value for gauge theories whose center is trivial or explicitly broken by the presence of dynamical matter fields. At high temperatures, the saddle point structure of the effective potential is different from the low temperature case suggesting that the theory is in the deconfined phase. At finite N , the Polyakov loop is non-zero in the high temperature phase only in theories with no unbroken center symmetry, consistent with screening of the external charge introduced by the Polyakov loop and Gauss law on a compact space.},

abstract = {Motivated by the possible observation of the $\Theta$+(1530),  we study the quark structure of pentaquark states in quenched lattice  QCD. The complete set of 19 local sources that have the proper symmetry  for positive or negative parity isoscalar pentaquarks is constructed, as  well as a nonlocal source composed of two displaced ``good'' diquarks.  Quantitative structure information is determined from diagonalizing the  19-dimensional correlation matrix and from calculating the overlaps of  sources with the lattice eigenstates. The volume dependence of the  overlap is studied to differentiate between scattering and localized  resonant states. The positive parity state has a small component of two  ``good'' diquarks, and its energy is too much higher than the negative  parity state to be a candidate for the $\Theta$+(1530).},

abstract = {Recently, a finite-temperature real-time static potential has been introduced via a Schr\"{o}dinger-type equation satisfied by a certain heavy quarkonium Green's function. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that it possesses an imaginary part, which induces a finite width for the tip of the quarkonium peak in the thermal dilepton production rate. The imaginary part originates from Landau-damping of low-frequency gauge fields, which are essentially classical due to their high occupation number. Here we show how the imaginary part can be measured with classical lattice gauge theory simulations, accounting non-perturbatively for the infrared sector of finite-temperature field theory. We demonstrate that a non-vanishing imaginary part indeed exists non-perturbatively; and that its value agrees semi-quantitatively with that predicted by Hard Loop resummed perturbation theory.},

@article{Liu2007,
abstract = {Expectation values of Wilson loops define the nonperturbative properties of the hot medium produced in heavy ion collisions that arise in the analysis of both radiative parton energy loss and quarkonium suppression. We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate the expectation values of such Wilson loops in the strongly coupled plasma of = 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, allowing for the possibility that the plasma may be moving with some collective flow velocity as is the case in heavy ion collisions. We obtain the = 4 SYM values of the jet quenching parameter , which describes the energy loss of a hard parton in QCD, and of the velocity-dependence of the quark-antiquark screening length for a moving dipole as a function of the angle between its velocity and its orientation. We show that if the quark-gluon plasma is flowing with velocity vf at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the trajectory of a hard parton, the jet quenching parameter is modified by a factor $\gamma$f(1−vf cos $\theta$), and show that this result applies in QCD as in = 4 SYM. We discuss the relevance of the lessons we are learning from all these calculations to heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between our results and those obtained in other theories with gravity duals, showing in particular that the ratio between in any two conformal theories with gravity duals is the square root of the ratio of their central charges. This leads us to conjecture that in nonconformal theories defines a quantity that always decreases along renormalization group trajectories and allows us to use our calculation of in = 4 SYM to make a conjecture for its value in QCD.},

Surprisingly, in the large j limit, they reproduce some properties of the ordinary coherent states on the non commutative plane.},

abstract = {In this work, we study the spin and flavor dependent SU(6) violations in the strange and nonstrange baryons spectrum using a simple approach based on the Gursey Radicati mass formula (GR). The average energy value of each SU(6) multiplet is described using the SU(6) invariant interaction given by a hypercentral potential. In this paper the hypercentral potential is regarded as a combination of the Coulombic-like term plus a linear confining term and we have added the harmonic oscillator potential. In fact, we have built up a potential scheme for the internal baryon structure which has three-body forces among three quarks. The results of our model (the combination of our proposed hypercentral Potential and generalized GR mass formula to description of the spectrum) show that the strange and nonstrange baryons spectrum are, in general, fairly well reproduced. The overall good description of the spectrum which we obtain shows that our model can also be used to give a fair description of the energies of the excited multiplets at least up to 2 GeV and negative-parity resonance. Moreover, we have shown that our model reproduces the position of the Roper resonances of the nucleon.},

abstract = {We describe a construction of fuzzy spaces which approximate projective toric varieties. The construction uses the canonical embedding of such varieties into a complex projective space: The algebra of fuzzy functions on a toric variety is obtained by a restriction of the fuzzy algebra of functions on the complex projective space appearing in the embedding. We give several explicit examples for this construction; in particular, we present fuzzy weighted projective spaces as well as fuzzy Hirzebruch and del Pezzo surfaces. As our construction is actually suited for arbitrary subvarieties of complex projective spaces, one can easily obtain large classes of fuzzy Calabi-Yau manifolds and we comment on fuzzy K3 surfaces and fuzzy quintic three-folds. Besides enlarging the number of available fuzzy spaces significantly, we show that the fuzzification of a projective toric variety amounts to a quantization of its toric base.},

For masses we also check through a Crank Nichelson discretization. For hybrid charmonium mesons, we consider the exotic quantum number states with J(PC) = 0(+-), 1(-+) and 2(+-). We also compare our results with the experimentally observed masses and theoretically predicted results of the other models.

abstract = {In this paper we re-derive the effective Nambu-Goto theory result for the Polyakov loop correlator, starting from the free bosonic string and using a covariant quantization. The boundary conditions are those of an open string attached to two D0-branes at spatial distance R, in a target space with compact euclidean time. The one-loop free energy contains topologically distinct sectors corresponding to multiple covers of the cylinder in target space bordered by the Polyakov loops. The sector that winds once reproduces exactly the Nambu-Goto partition function. In our approach, the world-sheet duality between the open and closed channel is most evident and allows for an explicit interpretation of the free energy in terms of tree level exchange of closed strings between boundary states. Our treatment is fully consistent only in d = 26; extension to generic d may be justified for large R, and is supported by Montecarlo data. At shorter scales, consistency and Montecarlo data seem to suggest the necessity of taking into account the Liouville mode of Polyakov's formulation.},

abstract = {We consider the Nambu-Goto bosonic string model as a description of the physics of interfaces. By using the standard covariant quantization of the bosonic string, we derive an exact expression for the partition function in dependence of the geometry of the interface. Our expression, obtained by operatorial methods, resums the loop expansion of the NG model in the ``physical gauge'' computed perturbatively by functional integral methods in the literature. Recently, very accurate Monte Carlo data for the interface free energy in the 3d Ising model became available. Our proposed expression compares very well to the data for values of the area sufficiently large in terms of the inverse string tension. This pattern is expected on theoretical grounds and agrees with previous analyses of other observables in the Ising model.},

Gluon fields inside mesons and baryons with static (infinitely heavy) quarks are described. The breaking, due to the creation of a quark antiquark pair from a vacuum, of the string that couples quarks into hadrons is discussed. The finite temperature QCD phase transition is considered. The results obtained show that the QCD vacuum behaves as a dual superconductor and that color confinement is due to the formation of a dual analog of the Abrikosov string.},

abstract = {We present a non-perturbative study of the equation of state in the decontined phase of Yang-Mills theories in D = 2 + 1 dimensions. We introduce a holographic model, based on flue improved holographic QCD model, from which we derive a non-trivial relation between the order of the \&amp;confinement phase transition and the behavior of the trace of the energ,y-momentum tensor as a function of the temperature T. We compare the theoretical predictions of this holographic model with a new set of high-precision numerical results from lattice simulations of SU(N) theories with N = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 colors. The latter reveal that, similarly to the D = 3 + 1 case, the bulk equilibrium thermodynamic quantities (pressure, trace of the energy-momentum tensor, energy density and entropy density) exhibit nearly perfect proportionality to the number of gluons, and can be successfully compared with the holographic predictions in a broad range of temperatures. Finally, we also show that, again similarly to the d = 3 + 1 case, the trace of the energy-moment urn tensor appears to be proportional to T-2 in a wide temperature range, starting from approximately 1.2 T-c, where T-C denotes the critical \&amp;confinement temperature.},

abstract = {It has recently been pointed out that simple scaling properties of Polyakov correlation functions of gauge systems in the confining phase suggest that the ratios of k-string tensions in the low temperature region is constant up to terms of order T-3. Here we argue that, at least in a three-dimensional Z(4) gauge model, the above ratios are constant in the whole confining phase. This result is obtained by combining numerical experiments with known exact results on the mass spectrum of an integrable two-dimensional spin model describing the infrared behaviour of the gauge system near the deconfining transition.},

abstract = {We discuss a way to evaluate the full prediction for the interquark potential which is expected from the effective Nambu-Goto string model. We check the correctness of the prescription reproducing the results obtained with the zeta function regularization for the first two perturbative orders. We compare the predictions with existing Monte Carlo data for the (2+1) dimensional Z(2), SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories: in the low temperature regime, we find good agreement for large enough interquark distances, but an increasing mismatch between theoretical predictions and numerical results is observed as shorter and shorter distances are investigated. On the contrary, at high temperatures (approaching the deconfinement transition from below) a remarkable agreement between Monte Carlo data and the expectations from the Nambu-Goto effective string is observed for a wide range of interquark distances.},

As order parameter, we consider the dual string tension or center vortex free energy, which we measure in SO(3) using multicanonical Monte Carlo. This allows us to set the scale, indicating that O(700)(4) lattices are necessary to probe the confined phase.

 strings with tensions depending on the specific representation rather than on its N -ality.
 Similarly at the deconfining temperature these sources carry their own representation-dependent
 critical exponents. It is pointed out that in some instances one can evaluate exactly these
 exponents by fully exploiting the correspondence between the 2+1 dimensional critical gauge theory
 and the 2 d conformal field theory in the same universality class. The emerging functional form of
 the Polyakov-line correlators suggests a similar form for Wilson loops in higher representations
 which helps in understanding the behaviour of unstable strings at T = 0. A generalised Wilson loop
 in which along part of its trajectory a source is converted in a gauge invariant way into higher
 representations with same N -ality could be used as a tool to estimate the decay scale of the
 unstable strings.},

We have seen that there is some intermediate range of distances for which the string tension is proportional to the quadratic Casimir of the quark color representation; the dependence shifts to N-ality only at asymptotic distances. How is Casimir scaling to be understood, in the context of the center vortex mechanism? A second question is whether vortices can be understood as the classical solutions of some effective gauge theory action, which is relevant to large scales. Finally, is it possible to devise a simple theory of fluctuating vortex surfaces, which would describe the behavior of non-abelian gauge theories in the infrared regime?},

The magnetic monopoles are characterized by two charges which are shown to determine the Pontrjagin index. Qualitative dynamical aspects of the role of the monopoles are discussed. It is argued that the entropy associated with monopoles increases with decreasing temperature and that the coupling to quantum fluctuations favors monopole-antimonopole binding.

abstract = {It appears well accepted in the literature that the correlator of Polyakov loops in a finite temperature system decays with the average free energy of the static quark-antiquark system and can be decomposed into singlet and adjoint (or octet for QCD) contributions. By fixing a gauge respecting the transfer matrix, attempts have been made to extract those contributions separately. In this paper we point out that the average and adjoint channels of Polyakov loop correlators are misconceptions. We show analytically that all channels receive contributions from singlet states only, and give a corrected definition of the singlet free energy. We verify this finding by simulations of the 3D SU(2) pure gauge theory in the zero-temperature limit, which allows one to cleanly extract the ground state exponents and the nontrivial matrix elements. The latter account for the difference between the channels observed in previous simulations.},

This group was first discovered by Niederer in the context of the free Schrodinger equation. We also provide a road map from the free nonrelativistic point particle to the equations of fluid mechanics to which the symmetry carries over. The hitherto unnoticed SL(2,R) part of the symmetry group for fluid mechanics gives a theoretical explanation for an observed similarity between numerical simulations of supernova explosions and numerical simulations of experiments involving laser-induced implosions in inertial confinement plasmas. We also give examples of interacting many-body systems of point particles which have this symmetry group. (C) 2001 American Association of Physics Teachers.},

This result purports to offer a theoretical explanation for an intriguing similarity, that was recently observed, between a supernova. explosion and a plasma implosion. In this paper we extend this result to discuss the symmetries of discontinuous flows, which further validates the explanation by taking into account shock waves, which are the driving force behind both the explosion and implosion. This is accomplished by constructing a new set of Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, which follow from Noether's conservation laws. The new set is dual to the standard Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and is related to them through the SL (2, R) transformations. The entropy condition, that the shock needs to satisfy for physical reasons, is also seen to remain invariant under the transformations. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In 1979, Louis Witten demonstrated that stationary axially symmetric Einstein field equations and those for static axially symmetric self-dual SU(2) gauge fields can both be reduced to the same (Ernst) equation. In this paper, we use this result as point of departure to prove the existence of the mass gap for quantum source-free Yang-Mills (Y-M) fields. The proof is facilitated by results of our recently published paper, J. Geom. Phys. 59 (2009) 600-619. Since both pure gravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially symmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum descriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is successfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin and Nicolai, Nucl. Phys. B 475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum gravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S)-type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for description of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require extension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is nontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) of the standard model. This result is quite rigid and should be taken into account in development of all grand unified theories. Also, the alternative (to the F-S-like) model emerges as by-product of such an extension. Both models are related to each other via known symmetry transformation. Both models possess gap in their excitation spectrum and are capable of producing knotted/linked configurations of gauge/gravity fields. In addition, the paper discusses relevance of the obtained results to heterotic strings and to scattering processes involving topology change. It ends with discussion about usefulness of this information for searches of Higgs boson.},

abstract = {We derive a static potential for a heavy quark-antiquark pair propagating in Minkowski time at finite temperature, by defining a suitable gauge-invariant Green's function and computing it to first non-trivial order in Hard Thermal Loop resummed perturbation theory. The resulting Debye-screened potential could be used in models that attempt to describe the ``melting'' of heavy quarkonium at high temperatures. We show, in particular, that the potential develops an imaginary part, implying that thermal effects generate a finite width for the quarkonium peak in the dilepton production rate. For quarkonium with a very heavy constituent mass M, the width can be ignored for Tg2M/12$\pi$, where g2 is the strong gauge coupling; for a physical case like bottomonium, it could become important at temperatures as low as 250 MeV. Finally, we point out that the physics related to the finite width originates from the Landau-damping of low-frequency gauge fields, and could be studied non-perturbatively by making use of the classical approximation.},

abstract = {A singular point in a two-dimensional velocity field is a stationary point of flow. The simplest and most important singularities in oceanography are points of convergence (or divergence), neutral points, and lines of convergence (or divergence). In the neighbourhood of the singularity, the velocity field is approximated linearly in terms of coordinates whose origin is taken at the singularity. The linear velocity field thus considered consists of the rates of stretching deformation and shearing deformation, vorticity, and divergence (or negative convergence). A group of foreign particles initially arranged in a circle surrounding a singularity will be deformed into an ellipse the area of which increases or decreases with time depending on the sign of the divergence. When a random motion is superposed upon the velocity field, a group of particles will be subject to advection-diffusion. As a result of the combined action of the rates of stretching and shearing, vorticity, and random motion, the group size tends to grow against a collecting power of convergence toward the singularity. Asymptotically a stationary situation may be established in which a group of particles attains a certain limiting size. Only the theoretical aspect is considered.},

 the theory has a second order deconfinement transition to a phase where the eigenvalue distribution
 of the Polyakov loop is non-uniform but still spread over the whole unit circle. At a higher
 temperature, the eigenvalue distribution develops a gap, via an additional third-order phase
 transition. We discuss possible forms of the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and
 sphere radius. Our results together with extrapolation of lattice results relevant to the large
 volume limit imply the existence of a critical radius in the phase diagram at which the
 deconfinement transition switches from second order to first order. We show that the point at the
 critical radius and temperature can be either a tricritical point with universal behavior or a
 triple point separating three distinct phases.},

@article{Processes2007,
abstract = {The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth. It extends along the west coast of South America from southern Chile (\~{}42 S) up to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands near the equator. The general oceanography of the HCS is characterised by a predominant northward flow of surface waters of subantarctic origin and by strong upwelling of cool nutrient-rich subsurface waters of equatorial origin. Along the coast of northern and central Chile, upwelling is localised and its occurrence changes from being mostly continuous (aseasonal) in northern Chile to a more seasonal pattern in southern-central Chile. Several important upwelling centres along the Chilean coast are interspersed with long stretches of coast without or with sporadic and less intense upwelling. Large-scale climatic phenomena (El Ni o Southern Oscillation, ENSO) are superimposed onto this regional pattern, which results in a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, complicating the prediction of ecological processes along the Chilean coast. This limited predictability becomes particularly critical in light of increasing human activities during the past decades, at present mainly in the form of exploitation of renewable resources (fish, invertebrates and macroalgae). This review examines current knowledge of ecolog- ical processes in the HCS of northern and central Chile, with a particular focus on oceanographic factors and the influence of human activities, and further suggests conservation strategies for this high-priority large marine ecosystem. Along the Chilean coast, the injection of nutrients into surface waters through upwelling events results in extremely high primary production. This fuels zoo- plankton and fish production over extensive areas, which also supports higher trophic levels, including large populations of seabirds and marine mammals. Pelagic fisheries, typically concen- trated near main upwelling centres (2022 S, 3234 S, 3638 S), take an important share of the fish production, thereby affecting trophic interactions in the HCS. Interestingly, El Ni o (EN) events in northern Chile do not appear to cause a dramatic decline in primary or zooplankton production but rather a shift in species composition, which affects trophic efficiency of and interactions among higher-level consumers. The low oxygen concentrations in subsurface waters of the HCS (oxygen- minimum zone, OMZ) influence predator-prey interactions in the plankton by preventing some species from migrating to deeper waters. The OMZ also has a strong effect on the bathymetric distribution of sublittoral soft-bottom communities along the Chilean coast. The few long-term studies available from sublittoral soft-bottom communities in northern and central Chile suggest that temporal dynamics in abundance and community composition are driven by interannual phe- nomena (EN and the extent and intensity of the OMZ) rather than by intra-annual (seasonal) patterns. Macrobenthic communities within the OMZ are often dominated in biomass by sulphide-oxidising, mat-forming bacteria. Though the contribution of these microbial communities to the total primary production of the system and their function in structuring OMZ communities is still scarcely known, they presumably play a key role, also in sustaining large populations of economically valuable crustaceans. Sublittoral hard bottoms in shallow waters are dominated by macroalgae and suspen- sion feeder reefs, which concentrate planktonic resources (nutrients and suspended matter) and channel them into benthic food webs. These These communities persist for many years and local extinc- tions appear to be mainly driven by large-scale events such as EN, which causes direct mortality of benthic organisms due to lack of nutrients/food, high water temperatures, or burial under terrigenous sediments from river runoff. Historic extinctions in combination with local conditions (e.g., vicinity to upwelling centres or substratum availability) produce a heterogeneous distribution pattern of benthic communities, which is also reflected in the diffuse biogeographic limits along the coast of northern-central Chile. Studies of population connectivity suggest that species with highly mobile planktonic dispersal stages maintain relatively continuous populations throughout most of the HCS, while populations of species with limited planktonic dispersal appear to feature high genetic structure over small spatial scales. The population dynamics of most species in the HCS are further influenced by geographic variation in propagule production (apparently caused by local differences in primary production), by temporal variation in recruit supply (caused by upwelling events, frontal systems and eddies), and topographically driven propagule retention (behind head- lands, in bay systems and upwelling shadows). Adults as well as larval stages show a wide range of different physiological, ecological and reproductive adaptations. This diversity in life-history strategies in combination with the high variability in environmental conditions (currents, food availability, predation risk, environmental stress) causes strong fluctuations in stocks of both planktonic and benthic resources. At present, it remains difficult to predict many of these fluctua- tions, which poses particular challenges for the management of exploited resources and the con- servation of biodiversity in the HCS. The high spatiotemporal variability in factors affecting ecological processes and the often-unpredictable outcome call for fine-scale monitoring of recruit- ment and stock dynamics. In order to translate this ecological information into sustainable use of resources, adaptive and co-participative management plans are recommended. Identification of areas with high biodiversity, source and sink regions for propagules and connectivity among local populations together with developing a systematic conservation planning, which incorporates deci- sion support systems, are important tasks that need to be resolved in order to create an efficient network of Marine Protected Areas along the coast of northern-central Chile. Farther offshore, the continental shelf and the deep-sea trenches off the Chilean coast play an important role in bio- geochemical cycles, which may be highly sensitive to climatic change. Research in this area should be intensified, for which modern research vessels are required. Biodiversity inventories must be accompanied by efforts to foster taxonomic expertise and museum collections (which should integrate morphological and molecular information). Conservation goals set for the next decade can only be achieved with the incorporation of local stakeholders and the establishment of efficient administrative structures. The dynamic system of the HCS in northern-central Chile can only be understood and managed efficiently if a fluent communication between stakeholders, administrators, scientists and politicians is guaranteed.},

abstract = {In this paper we calculated the nonstrange baryon masses based on the Gursey-Radicati mass formula (GR). The average energy value of each SU(6) multiplet is described using the SU(6) invariant interaction given by a hypercentral potential. In this work we take the hypercentral potential as a combination of the Coulombic like term, a linear confining term, plus a harmonic oscillator potential. In order to obtain the average energy value of each SU(6) multiplet, we have analytically solved the radial Schrodinger equation for our proposed potential exactly. The results of our model (combining our proposed hypercentral potential and the generalized GR mass formula to obtain a description of the spectrum) show that both the spin and flavor dependent terms in the quark Hamiltonian are important and the spectra of the nonstrange baryons are in general well reproduced. The overall good description of the spectra which we obtain shows that our model can also be used to give a fair description of the energies of the excited multiplets, at least up to 2 GeV and the negative-parity resonances.},

@article{Shuryak2009,
abstract = {This review covers our current understanding of strongly coupled Quark–Gluon Plasma (sQGP), especially theoretical progress in: (i) explaining the RHIC data by hydrodynamics; (ii) describing lattice data using electric–magnetic duality; (iii) understanding of gauge-string duality known as AdS/CFT and its application for “conformal” plasma. In view of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject, we include a brief introduction into several topics “for pedestrians”. Some fundamental questions addressed are: Why is sQGP such a good liquid? What is the nature of (de)confinement and what do we know about “magnetic” objects creating it? Do they play any important role in sQGP physics? Can we understand the AdS/CFT predictions, from the gauge theory side? Can they be tested experimentally? Can AdS/CFT duality help us understand rapid equilibration/entropy production? Can we work out a complete dynamical “gravity dual” to heavy ion collisions?},

@article{Tulloch2011,
abstract = {We present results from an ensemble of simulations where a buoyant dye is injected at the site of the Deepwater Horizon blowout from April 20 to July 15 of each year between 1992 and 2007. Ocean currents are taken from observationally constrained Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase 2 (ECCO2) project state estimates spanning 1992 to 2007. Starting from this basis, we explore the utility of adjoint equations in allowing proactive evaluation of regional impact likelihood. Forward integrations are performed to assess the ensemble spread of the plume, the role of increased resolution of ocean eddies, and to compare spreading metrics using an Eulerian tracer and Lagrangian particles. Spreading statistics compare well with previous studies, and the Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches predict similar spreading rates, allowing some confidence in adjoint sensitivity analysis of the vulnerability of different local coastline regions to be conducted. Example adjoint calculations indicate that coastline of the Mississippi Delta is most sensitive to spills on the continental shelf off adjacent to Mississippi and Alabama, while Cape Hatteras, for example, is most sensitive to spills on the continental shelf from Delaware to South Carolina. Combined with accurate estimates of historical currents and winds, we argue that the adjoint approach we describe can be a useful regional planning and preparedness tool. Using the adjoint approach, local communities can proactively identify spill locations to which they are especially vulnerable, allowing for better preparedness and more efficient response to any future incidents.},

@article{Ward2012,
abstract = {We present a model of diverse phytoplankton and zooplankton populations embedded in a global ocean circulation model. Physiological and ecological traits of the organisms are constrained by relationships with cell size. The model qualitatively reproduces global distributions of nutrients, biomass, and primary productivity, and captures the power-law relationship between cell size and numerical density, which has realistic slopes of between −1.3 and −0.8. We use the model to explore the global structure of marine ecosystems, highlighting the importance of both nutrient and grazer controls. The model suggests that zooplankton : phytoplankton (Z : P) biomass ratios may vary from an order of 0.1 in the oligotrophic gyres to an order of 10 in upwelling and high-latitude regions. Global estimates of the strength of bottom-up and top-down controls within plankton size classes suggest that these large-scale gradients in Z : P ratios are driven by a shift from strong bottom-up, nutrient limitation in the oligotrophic gyres to the dominance of top-down, grazing controls in more productive regions.},
